According to Wikipedia, A fractal is generally "a rough or fragmented geometric shape that 
can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of 
the whole,"[1] a property called self-similarity.   

This PHP script draws a Koch Curve which is a type of Fractal. 
It simply takes an integer as the Koch Curve level and draws it as a jpeg image.
This image can be downloaded like any normal image.
